## Important notes


- You need at least **Rainmeter 4.0 (r2746) or higher** to get all features of this skin. You can find the newest version on https://www.rainmeter.net/
- After installation you can access the settings by right-clicking the visualizer or song information and then clicking on Open Settings.
- Due to limitations of Rainmeter/the plugin used for the visualization the complete audio output of your system will be shown on the visualizer. For the best experience only play music. This is something I canâ€™t fix.
